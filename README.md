# low tides
a tool to find low tides given a region and timeframe utilizing noaa's api. intended for picking [tidepooling](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/tide-pool.html) locations.

I couldn't find an endpoint to retrieve station ids, so I scraped NOAA for all the station ids in each region and parsed it into a json. not ideal but I figured implementing a webdriver to scrape a dynamic list wouldn't be worth the hassle.
